# React Todo List with Vite

This project is a simple todo list built using React and Vite. It provides a minimal setup to get started with React development, including HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for fast updates during development. The project structure includes components for managing todo items and styling using CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-todo-list
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the todo list in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
